### README

This assignment includes 
* building a **three layer perceptron from scratch**, 
* extending this to a **Deep (Multi-layer) Neural Network**,
* training a **deep convolutional neural network** on the MNIST dataset with **Tensorflow**, 
and  
* using **TensorBoard** to **visualize the training process**.
